# rcrpfisher
A simple Red County Roleplay auto fishing script wrote in Python. By default, after 5 tries it automatically stores all the fishes in your crate, then resets the tries variable to 5.

# Requirements
Python3
pyautogui (Make sure to install the 'pyautogui' module by running "python3 -m pip install pyautogui")

# How to use it
Just run the CMD, move to the directory where the script is located, and run "python rcrpfisher.py". Afterwards, head ingame and let the script catch all the fishes!
