# rcrpfisher
A simple Red County Roleplay (SAMP) auto-fishing script wrote in Python. By default, after 5 tries the script will automatically store all the fishes in your crate, then resets the tries variable to 5. You can just set the variable to your wishing number.

# Requirements
python3 <br>
pyautogui (Make sure to install the 'pyautogui' module by running "python3 -m pip install pyautogui")

# How to use it
Open the terminal or CMD, move to the directory where the script is located, and run "python rcrpfisher.py". Afterwards, head ingame and let the script catch all the fishes!
